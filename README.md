## Overview
The Flappy Bird game is implemented using Python and the Pygame library. The AI agent is trained to play the game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, which is a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks to solve a given problem.

The main features of the project include:
- Flappy Bird game logic
- NEAT algorithm implementation for training the AI agent
- Visualization of the game and training process

## Demo
Here is a video demonstration of the Flappy Bird game being played by the trained AI agent:
